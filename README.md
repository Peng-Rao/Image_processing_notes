This repository contains notes and the solution of assignment in the lectures. Course Link: https://boracchi.faculty.polimi.it/teaching/MMMIP.htm

## Contents

- Image models based on orthonormal bases (DCT), data-driven basis (PCA), and local polynomial approximation.
- Sparsity and redundancy.
- Applications of sparse models to image denoising, inpainting, anomaly detection.
- Robust fitting methods (RANSAC) and their sequential counterparts.
